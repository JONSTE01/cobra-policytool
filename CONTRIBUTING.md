Contributing Guidelines
=======================

In order to maintain a good level of quality, we require that
contributions (external as well as internal) meet the following goals:

* All features fit the project goals, as described in the [readme](README.md).

* All features are documented.

* Unit tests for all features.

* Source code follows the [code standard](CODE_STANDARD.md).
